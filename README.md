To run this test and see the issue do the folliwng:

---
## First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then I just do my `yarn ci`


You will see that all tests app. I am aware these are super simple tests, but just want an idea of where I might be failing.

Maybe I might be assuming that the E2E tests would check that the fact there is a redirect, it would assume it passes the tests, and therefore get the code coverage up. But apparently not.

Thanks
